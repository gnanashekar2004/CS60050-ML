# CS60050 - Machine Learning Projects
This repository contains various machine learning projects completed as part of the CS60050 - Machine Learning course. Each project is organized into a separate folder, and details about each project can be found in their respective README files.

## Projects:
- **Project 1: Linear Regression and Logistic Regression** (Asgn1):
README.md: Details about the linear regression and logistic regression implementations without using any machine learning libraries. Includes information about dataset splitting, model formulation, and performance evaluation.
- **Project 2: Decision Trees and k-fold Cross Validation** (Asgn2):
README.md: Details about the Support Vector Machines (SVM) implementation with regularization, kernel tricks, overfitting & underfitting, and probability, as well as Naive Bayes. Includes information about dataset, model implementation, and evaluation metrics.
- **Project 3: Support Vector Machines and Naive Bayes** (Asgn3):
README.md: Details about the projects involving decision trees, reduced error pruning, and k-fold cross-validation. Includes information about dataset splitting, model implementation, and evaluation metrics.
