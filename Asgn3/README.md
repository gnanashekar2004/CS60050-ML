# Programming Assignment: Support Vector Machines and Naive Bayes
## Description:
This programming assignment involves implementing and experimenting with Support Vector Machines (SVM) for classifying a dataset. The assignment covers concepts such as regularization, kernel tricks, overfitting, and underfitting, and their impact on SVM performance. Additionally, it includes working with Naive Bayes for email spam classification.
