# Machine Learning Assignment: Decision Trees and k-fold Cross Validation
## Description:
This assignment involves implementing decision trees and k-fold cross-validation without using any machine learning libraries. For decision trees, the ID3 algorithm is implemented for classification tasks, and reduced error pruning is applied to improve the model. For k-fold cross-validation, a logistic regression model is trained and evaluated using the saga solver from scikit-learn without any regularization penalty.

## Install Packages:
To install the required packages, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
