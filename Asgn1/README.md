# Machine Learning Assignment: Linear Regression and Logistic Regression
## Description:
This assignment involves implementing linear regression and logistic regression without using any machine learning libraries. For linear regression, both an analytic solution and an iterative solution via gradient ascent are implemented. For logistic regression, a standard logistic regression classifier is implemented.

## Install Dependencies:
To install the required packages, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Folder Structure:
The project contains two folders:
### Linear Regression:
code.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook file containing the implementation of linear regression models.
report.pdf: PDF file with cell outputs and explanations for the linear regression implementation.
### Logistic Regression:

code.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook file containing the implementation of logistic regression classifier.
report.pdf: PDF file with cell outputs and explanations for the logistic regression implementation.
